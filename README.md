Youtube

Well What do I have to say ? I really like to use youtube as a method of study, it keeps me updated even when I dont have time to read or test stuff! Does not substitute good ol' reading and lab tests, but it is fun to watch sometimes and I always learn something new :) 

Here are some of my recommendations that I used to study in a very passive and fun way :)
